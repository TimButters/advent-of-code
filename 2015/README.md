* Advent of Code 2015

I learnt a bit of Haskell a few years ago and really enjoyed it, but I haven't done anything with it since. So, I decided to work through the (2015 Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/2015] puzzles in Haskell to brush up on my skills.

It won't be good, but they will hopefully work, and if all goes well the quality of the code will improve with each puzzle.
